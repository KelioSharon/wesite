            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1><br>
    <h2>My Name Is Kelio Sharon</h2>
    <p>I am a model born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya. I had a passion for modelling from a young age of 17.After finishing High school, 
        I decided to take part in beauty contests as a part-time career as I tackle my College studies.
         I've taken part in a couple of modelling events and competitions and since then my star has rapidly risen. Recently, Ive been booking Gigs  that include;
         fashion shows, commercials, music videos and this has been motivating me so far.</p><BR>
    <p>A couple of the events that ive participated in include; 
        <ul><BR>
        <li>MR& Miss Nakuru,Kenya</li>
        <li>MR& Miss Face of Nakuru</li>
        <li>MR& Miss Kabarak University</li>
        <li>MR& Miss Kenya</li>
        <li>Denri products marketing</li>
        <li>Hotel goodputt marketing</li>
    </ul>
 This has so far boosted my confidence and skills, securing contracts with top fashion houses and many more and I'd like working with you too.
